- look into other distro specs for valid %descriptions for samba 3
- unpackaged man pages for modules that are not built by default,
  maybe we should build them?

- libmsrpc.so is broken (references smbc_attr_server() which is no longer exported from libsmbclient)
- package libs:
      libnetapi
      libsmbsharemodes
- MERGE vfs modules into main package, what was the point of splitting these?
